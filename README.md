This is the repo for Introduction to Computer Science that I took in freshman year. My teammate and I built a chat system that communicates user information between the chat server and the client state machine that can simulate reliable messaging under poor network connection and autocorrect user mistakes at the same time. 

Functionalities we implemented include:
- Log in verification
- File transmission (emojis, files)
- Screenshot
- Chat history manipulation(search for commonly used words, clear chat history)
- Wordle Game (Source code adapted from a youtube video)
- Auto Correct (Source code adapted from https://github.com/fifimajster/autocorrect)
- Music Player
- Error correction under undesired network condition (convert texts to matrix and calculate "checksum")
